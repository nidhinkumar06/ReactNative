Installation of i18n:

>npm install react-native-i18n --save

Once installation is done link it with android using

>react-native link


Error:

<!-- undefined is not an object evaluation _i18n_I18n -->
Solution: should be in the folder structure as i18n -> locales

Earlier it was given as locales->i18-en.js
